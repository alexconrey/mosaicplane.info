# MOSAIC Plane Info

A comprehensive web application for exploring aircraft eligibility under the FAA's new MOSAIC (Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certificates) regulations, effective October 22, 2025.

## Overview

The MOSAIC regulations represent a revolutionary change in general aviation, expanding sport pilot privileges to approximately 70% of the existing GA fleet. This application helps pilots understand which aircraft they can legally operate under different certificate levels and what endorsements may be required.
